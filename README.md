# ADW7000W_Firmware
For Philips Fidelio ADW7000W/37 users this is the very last firmware version s9110.102.3710

The Philips Fidelio ADW700W/37 AirPlay speaker was discontinued by Philips.  Unfortunately the on-device firmware updates are no longer avaialble on their support site.  I have also come across many posts on the web indicating that not many users upgraded their firmware.  I was able to obtain from Philips the very last version of the firmware along with their upgrade procedure documents.  I'm preserving this here for anyone who still may have these devices.

This will update your Philips Fidelio ADW700W/37 to firmware version s9110.102.3710 which was released on 2012-04-15.  According to their technical support staff this is the very last version that was made avaialble to customers.  Althogh I have no release notes for this version I am told it improves WiFi connection reliablity.

# Instructions
- Read through the PDF file on how to upgrade the speaker
- Once the device is on your network, directly connect via it's IP address in any web browser
- Select the firmware update tab and follow the instructions in the PDF

NOTE: This may reset your speaker back to the factory config.  So you may have to put it in setup mode by holding the button in the back until it's flashing orange then connect directly to its WiFi network and visit 192.168.1.1 in your web browser to re-enable it's configuration.
